### Hi there, I'm Guglielmo 👋
I'm doing a PhD in  at the Scuola Internazione Superiore di Studi Avanzati (SISSA).  
- 🔭 I’m doing **research** at [*mathLab*](https://mathlab.sissa.it/) @ SISSA
  - Generative Models
  - Shape Deformation
  - Fluid dynamics simulations

- 🌱 I’m currently **learning**  
  - Continuum Mechanics
  - Navier Stokes equations

- 📫 How to reach me:
  - my email address is **gpadula@sissa.it**

- ❓ Curiosities:
  - I try to keep all my repositories public. As a consequence only few them have clean code.
